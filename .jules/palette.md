## 2024-04-03 - Accessible Async Action Loading States
**Learning:** While this app uses distinct button classes with clear visual indicators, `aria-busy` and explicit spinning icons are often missing from async action submission buttons. This prevents screen reader users from understanding that an operation (like executing a search or database garbage collection) is actively in-progress, and visual users can be confused by the lack of clear loading state.
**Action:** When adding visual loading states (`animate-spin` on a `Loader2` icon), always pair them with the `aria-busy={loading}` attribute on the button/form to ensure screen-readers announce the progressing state.
